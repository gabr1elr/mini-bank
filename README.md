Mini Bank System (C++)

This project is a simple console-based banking application written in C++. It simulates the basic functionality of a bank account, allowing a user to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, and check the current balance through an interactive menu.

The project is intended as an introductory exercise for working with structures, functions, user input, and control flow in C++.
